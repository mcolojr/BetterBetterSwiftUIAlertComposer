# SwiftUI - BetterBetterSwiftUIAlertComposer

The **BetterBetterSwiftUIAlertComposer** is a flexible Swift package designed to simplify alert management in SwiftUI. 
It dynamically presents alerts based on setting a current alert configuration, eliminating the need for manual state management using Boolean flags.

## Why Use BetterBetterSwiftUIAlertComposer?

SwiftUI's built-in alert presentation often relies on a boolean flag to show or hide alerts. However, when alert content (title, message, actions) changes dynamically, managing alerts this way becomes cumbersome. 
**BetterBetterSwiftUIAlertComposer** solves this by using a current alert configuration-based approach, allowing alerts to be presented simply by defining and setting an alert configuration.

                message: "Operation completed successfully.",
                actions: [
                    AlertConfiguration.AlertAction(
                        title: "OK",
                        isPrimaryAction: true,
                        action: { 
                            print("OK tapped")
                        }
                    )
                ]

        title: "Warning",
        message: "Are you sure you want to delete this item?",
        actions: [
            .init(
                title: "Cancel",
                role: .cancel
            ),
            .init(
                title: "Delete",
                role: .destructive,
                action: { 
                    print("Item deleted")
                }
            )
        ]
    )
}
.alertComposer(currentAlertConfiguration)
```
